# Variables and Data Types
## Variable
**Placeholder** in memory to hold data that can change and it has a specific data type, the **data type** will specify how much space is needed in the memory.

## Variable declaration
###Syntax:
	dataType variableName;
### Semantic:
- Take a space in memory and give it a name and data type


## Variable Assignment 
###Syntax:
	variableNames = Expression;
###Semantics:
- Evaluate the expression
- Store the value into the placeholder with corresponding variable name

## Variable Definition
###Syntax: 
	dataType variableName = Expression ; 
###Semantics:
- Take a space in memory and give it a name and data type
- Evaluate the expression
- Store the value into the placeholder with corresponding variable name

##Example:
#### Declaration:
	int num;
#### Assigment:
	num = 100;
#### Definition:
	int number = 100;

## Data Types
## Primitive Data Types:
Primitive data types you can only operations on them, but they don't have any methods attached to them
###Numerical:
#### Integers:
- 	byte                 8 bits
-	short				16 bits
-	int 				32 bits
- 	long				64 bits

#### Floating Point Numbers:
-	float				32 bits
-	double				64 bits

#### Characters
-	char				16 bits

#### Booleans
-	boolean				1  bit

## Referential Data Types/ ADT:
Referential data types have methods attached to them

-	String 
-	Scanner
- 	Program1
-	Integer
- 	Long 
- 	Boolean
